# HTTP-Server



About the Application
-------------------

This application provides the minimum necessary steps for hosting a HTTP server via Ethernet. First, the HTTP sockets are initialized. Then, the DHCP library is used to assign an Ethernet IP address for the device. When this address is navigated to in a web browser, a simple HTML page is displayed.
